The first question - before you get started on **any** spreadsheet project is why you would want to use a spreadsheet at all? There are a large number of tools which can be used to create dashboards, including R's Shiny package and Python's Bokeh package which you can learn right here at Datacamp.

The main reason is that spreadsheets are easy to set up and deploy to end users. 
There is no need for code which might be challenging to understand for less technical users, no need to deploy software or library packages which could be time intensive for IT teams.

It is very easy to change the look and feel of a spreadsheet dashboard, which makes it great for creating prototypes of more complex dashboards in R, Python or business intelligence software.
