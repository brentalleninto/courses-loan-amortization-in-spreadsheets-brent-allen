## What is a loan amortization table?

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "5fbc69299e"
```

`@part1`
A loan amortization table details the **periodic payment** of **interest **and **principal ** from a **borrower **to a **lender** over the life of a loan until the eventual repayment of a loan.

Amortization calculators create these tables and are normally used by borrowers to determine their installment payments.

`@script`
A loan amortization table details the relationship between interest and principal payments over the life of a loan.

Loan amortization tables are calculated for the borrower; that is the person who is receiving the loan.

Calculators, like the one we will be building in this course, help to determine how much interest rates and loan length impact payments.

`@script`
The traditional case where a loan amortization schedule is used is on a mortgage. 

A mortgage provides both a borrower and a lender consistency in the payments that they make over time. A borrower will not have to worry about wild fluctuations in their payments, and a lender will not have to worry about decreasing cash flows received over time.

An amortization schedule would not work for a credit card. One month the balance might be $1000, the next month $3000, and there might be no consistency in how much the borrower is paying. One month might be the minimum, the next month the borrower might pay off the balance in full.

While most amortization tables describe guaranteed loans - like a bank taking away a house if mortgage payments aren't received - it is not a requirement to have a guarantee to have an amortizing loan.

## Why use a spreadsheet for a loan amortization dashboard?

```yaml

`@part1`
- Easy for end users to pick up and users.
- Little to no cost to deploy to end users.
- Financial formulas already included.
- Easy to customize colors and formatting.
- Easy to create prototypes of more complex dashboards.

The first question - before you get started on **any** spreadsheet project is why you would want to use a spreadsheet at all? There are a large number of tools which can be used to create dashboards, including R's Shiny package and Python's Bokeh package which you can learn right here at Datacamp.

The main reason is that spreadsheets are easy to set up and deploy to end users. 
There is no need for code which might be challenging to understand for less technical users, no need to deploy software or library packages which could be time intensive for IT teams.

It is very easy to change the look and feel of a spreadsheet dashboard, which makes it great for creating prototypes of more complex dashboards in R, Python or business intelligence software.
