My name is Brent Allen. I'm a CPA and I've been working with spreadsheets for over 15 years, including 6 years in real estate. I'm excited to get you started on loan amortization dashboards in spreadsheets!

## What is a loan amortization table?

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "5fbc69299e"
```

`@part1`
A loan amortization table details the **periodic payment** of **interest **and **principal ** from a **borrower **to a **lender** over the life of a loan until the eventual repayment of a loan.

Amortization calculators create these tables and are normally used by borrowers to determine their installment payments.

`@script`
A loan amortization table details the relationship between interest and principal payments over the life of a loan.

Loan amortization tables are calculated for the borrower; that is the person who is receiving the loan.

Calculators, like the one we will be building in this course, help to determine how much interest rates and loan length impact payments.

`@script`
The traditional case where a loan amortization schedule is used is on a mortgage. 

A mortgage provides both a borrower and a lender consistency in the payments that they make over time. 

An amortization schedule would not work for a credit card. One month the balance might be $1000, the next month $3000, and there might be no consistency in how much the borrower is paying. One month might be the minimum, the next month the borrower might pay off the balance in full.

## Key Elements of an Amortization Table

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "578fff46a5"
```

`@part1`
### Required Elements

- Interest Rate
- Amortization Period of the Loan
- Frequency of Loan Payments
- Amount of the Loan
- Timing of Loan Payments


`@part2`
### Not Required Elements

- Inflation Rate
- Length of the Loan
- Value of the underlying purchase.


`@script`
In order to create an amortization table, there are several items that we need to have in order to create the calculation of the installment payments.

First, we need the interest rate - typically expressed as a nominal annual rate. We don't need to have the inflation rate to calculate real interest.

We need to know the amortization period of the loan; that is, how long will it take to pay off completely, and how frequently payments are being made - monthly, weekly, bi-weekly... these are a few examples. Normally, payments are made at the end of a period.

Finally - we need to know how much is actually being borrowed. And it doesn't matter what the money is being borrowed for. It could be a house, a car, a student loan - anything, really!

## Interest Rates

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "b1733db6f1"
center_content: true
```

`@part1`
- **Nominal Annual Interest Rate** - The annual rate which is provided on a loan, without compounding or inflation.

- **Periodic Nominal Interest Rate** = Nominal Annual Interest Rate / # of annual payments.

- **Annualized Percentage Rate (APR)** - An interest rate which includes all fees and periodic compounding.


`@part2`
![](http://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4102/datasets/16b7007435db6ccbb9e7013c6e31ab65ce6fc50a/MortgageRates.jpg)


`@script`
Posted rates for loans will normally refer to the nominal annual interest rate. That is - a loan posted at 6% will mean that if no payments were made during the year, the borrower would pay 6% of the opening balance after 1 year.

Periodic rates are simply the annual rate divided by the number of payments. So a monthly periodic rate at 6% would be 0.50%.

Annualized percentage rate; or APR, is typically found on products like credit cards with monthly rates or payday loans which have fees.

In the case of a credit card, a 1% monthly rate does not equal 12%; due to compounding it is closer to 12.7%. Payday loans can lead to APR well over 100%.

For most of this course, we will be using nominal and periodic rates until we discuss floating rates and fees.

## Amortization Period

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "767d4bb85e"
```

`@part1`
**Amortization Period** - The time that it will take to pay off a loan in full.

**Loan Term** - The time that the lender and borrower are committed to the interest rates in the contract.

![](http://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4102/datasets/eb669c140f0dd5c4953c679e5de9e4f05a1e96c0/loan_agreement.jpg)


`@script`
The amortization period is simply the amount of time, making payments on the schedule, that it will take to pay off the loan.

The loan term might detail out a fixed rate, or an amount over a preset rate which will remain constant over the life of the loan.

In some cases, like 30 year term loans or car loans, the loan term and amortization term are the same.
On some mortgages, terms can be much lower than the overall amortization - leading the borrower to take on a new loan or pay off the balance in full.

For now, we'll be making schedules for the entire amortization period of a loan.

Now that we have an understanding of what goes into the amortization schedule, the next step will be building up the formulas and creating the schedule.

See you there!
